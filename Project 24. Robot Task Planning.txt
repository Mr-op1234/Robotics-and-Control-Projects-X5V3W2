Description:
Task planning is the process of determining a sequence of actions that a robot must take to achieve a specific goal, considering the constraints of the environment and the robot's capabilities. In this project, we will implement a simple task planning system where a robot can plan a sequence of tasks (e.g., pick an object, move it to a destination) and execute them. We will use a basic search-based planning algorithm (e.g., Breadth-First Search) to plan a series of actions in a grid environment.
