Description:
Safety-critical control systems are essential in robotics, particularly for systems that operate in environments where failures could result in significant harm, such as autonomous vehicles, industrial robots, or medical robots. In this project, we will implement a safety-critical control system for a robot that incorporates safety mechanisms, such as emergency stop or collision avoidance. The robot will move towards a target while continuously checking for safety constraints (e.g., obstacles or out-of-bound conditions) and applying safety measures when necessary.
