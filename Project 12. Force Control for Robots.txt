Description:
Force control in robotics is used to control the interaction forces between a robot and its environment, such as when a robot manipulates objects or performs tasks like assembly or tactile exploration. The goal is to ensure that the robot applies the correct amount of force, preventing damage to the object or environment while maintaining efficient task performance. In this project, we will implement a simple force control system where the robot adjusts its force based on feedback from force sensors.
