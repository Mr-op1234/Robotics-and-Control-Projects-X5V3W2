Description:
Inverse kinematics (IK) is the mathematical process of determining the joint angles of a robot's arm or manipulator to achieve a desired end effector position (e.g., reaching a specific point in space). Solving inverse kinematics is a fundamental problem in robotics, particularly for robotic arms and manipulators. In this project, we will implement an inverse kinematics solver that calculates the joint angles for a robotic arm to reach a target position using a numerical or analytical approach.
