Description:
Transfer learning is a technique that leverages knowledge gained from one task to improve the performance on a related task. In robotics, transfer learning can be used to transfer knowledge from one robot or task to another, reducing the need for extensive retraining. In this project, we will apply transfer learning to a robotic system by training the robot to perform one task (e.g., grasping an object) and then transferring the learned model to a related task (e.g., picking up a different object). We will use a pre-trained model and fine-tune it for the new task.

ðŸ§ª Python Implementation (Transfer Learning for Robotics using Pretrained Model)
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# 1. Load a pre-trained model (e.g., a simple CNN for object classification)
# For simplicity, we will use a pretrained model on a generic task (e.g., image classification).
# You can replace this with a real robotic task model, e.g., for grasping.

base_model = keras.applications.MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Freeze the layers of the base model to retain the learned features
base_model.trainable = False

# 2. Build the full model for transfer learning
model = keras.Sequential([
    base_model,
    layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(),
    layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # For simplicity, binary classification (grasp/no grasp)
])

# 3. Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# 4. Simulate training data (for illustration, we'll use random images and labels)
# In a real-world scenario, you'd use images of objects and labels for the task (grasping or not grasping).
num_samples = 1000
X_train = np.random.rand(num_samples, 224, 224, 3)  # Random image data (1000 samples)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, num_samples)  # Random binary labels (0 or 1)

# 5. Fine-tune the model on the new task (object grasping)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# 6. Simulate transfer to a new robot task (e.g., grasping a new object)
# In practice, the model would be transferred and fine-tuned on the new robot's data.

X_test = np.random.rand(10, 224, 224, 3)  # Simulate new images of objects
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)  # Predict the grasping outcome for the new task

# 7. Visualize the results of transfer learning
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))

# Plot a sample of the predicted labels (grasp or no grasp)
plt.bar(range(10), y_pred.flatten(), color='blue', alpha=0.7, label="Predicted Grasping Probabilities")
plt.axhline(0.5, color='red', linestyle='--', label="Threshold (Grasp/No Grasp)")
plt.xlabel('Sample Index')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Grasping Probability')
