Description:
Sim-to-real transfer refers to the process of transferring a robot's learned behavior from a simulated environment to the real world. A key challenge in robotics is that models trained in simulation often do not perform well when deployed in real-world environments due to discrepancies between the simulation and reality (known as the reality gap). In this project, we will simulate a robot's movement in a controlled environment and then attempt to "transfer" this behavior to a real-world-like setup by applying simple adjustments to handle discrepancies, such as friction or noise.
