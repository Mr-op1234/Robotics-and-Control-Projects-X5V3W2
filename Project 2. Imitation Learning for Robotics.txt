Description:
Imitation learning (IL) allows robots to learn tasks by observing human demonstrations. Unlike traditional RL where agents explore the environment to learn, imitation learning relies on a set of examples (demonstrations) from an expert, and the robot learns to mimic the actions performed by the expert. This is particularly useful for robotic control tasks, where direct exploration may not be feasible or efficient. In this project, we will use behavioral cloning (a common imitation learning approach) to train a robot to perform tasks by mimicking human demonstrations.

ðŸ§ª Python Implementation (Imitation Learning for Robotics using Behavioral Cloning)
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np
import gym

# 1. Define the neural network model for behavioral cloning (Imitation Learning)
class ImitationLearningModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super(ImitationLearningModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, output_size)  # Output: predicted action

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)  # Output: predicted action

# 2. Define the Imitation Learning agent
class ImitationLearningAgent:
    def __init__(self, model, learning_rate=0.001):
        self.model = model
        self.optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
        self.criterion = nn.MSELoss()  # Loss function for behavioral cloning

    def train(self, states, actions):
        # Training the model on human demonstrations
        self.model.train()
        self.optimizer.zero_grad()
        predictions = self.model(states)  # Predicted actions from the model
        loss = self.criterion(predictions, actions)  # Loss between predicted and actual actions
        loss.backward()
        self.optimizer.step()
        return loss.item()

    def predict(self, state):
        # Predict the action to take based on the trained model
        self.model.eval()
        with torch.no_grad():
            return self.model(state)

# 3. Initialize the environment and Imitation Learning agent
env = gym.make('FetchReach-v1')  # Example environment for robotic task (Fetch robot reaching task)
model = ImitationLearningModel(input_size=env.observation_space.shape[0], output_size=env.action_space.shape[0])
agent = ImitationLearningAgent(model)

# 4. Collect demonstrations (human-provided data for training)
# For simplicity, we'll assume the demonstration data is pre-collected
# Example: Human-provided states and actions
# states = list of states observed from the human demonstration
# actions = list of actions taken by the human expert

states = np.random.rand(100, env.observation_space.shape[0])  # Simulated human demonstration states
actions = np.random.rand(100, env.action_space.shape[0])  # Simulated human demonstration actions

# Convert states and actions to PyTorch tensors
states_tensor = torch.tensor(states, dtype=torch.float32)
actions_tensor = torch.tensor(actions, dtype=torch.float32)

# 5. Train the agent using imitation learning
num_epochs = 50
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    loss = agent.train(states_tensor, actions_tensor)
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{num_epochs}, Loss: {loss:.4f}")

# 6. Evaluate the agent after training (imitation learning)
# Run the robot using the learned policy
state = env.reset()
done = False
total_reward = 0

while not done:
    action = agent.predict(torch.tensor(state, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0))  # Predict action based on trained model
    state, reward, done, _, _ = env.step(action.numpy()[0])
    total_reward += reward

print(f"Total reward after Imitation Learning: {total_reward}")
